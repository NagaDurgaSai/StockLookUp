This Android app, Stock Lookup, allows users to fetch real-time stock prices, percentage changes, and company details using the Alpha Vantage API. The app features a simple user interface where users input a stock symbol to retrieve the latest stock price. Upon entering the symbol, the app fetches and displays the stock's current price, percentage change, and the company's name.


Key Features: Stock Price Fetching: The app retrieves real-time stock data at 1-minute intervals and shows the current stock price. Percentage Change Display: The app calculates and displays the percentage change between the previous and current prices. Company Information: After fetching the stock price, the app also displays the company's name. Intuitive UI: The layout includes input fields for stock symbols, buttons to trigger data fetching, and clearly labeled text views to display results. Visual Cues: The stock price color changes to green or red based on whether the price has increased or decreased, and the price text animates to indicate updates.
